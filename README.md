# ncstate-utility-bar-plugin
A WordPress plugin for inserting the official NC State Utility Bar at the top of every page

### Usage policies:
The NC State brand utility bar offers a simple way to connect our thousands of websites and let Web users know where they are at all times. This element must appear at the top of all official NC State sites. No content or padding of any kind may appear above this bar. The utility bar is available in various color combinations (black, gray and red) consistent with official university colors, but it may not be edited or altered in any way beyond the options presented when embedding. The utility bar should only be used if the NC State logo is prominently displayed in the upper portion of your site.

For certain entities operating under unique circumstances, the utility bar might not be required. Exceptions will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Web Communications will provide support for the utility bar but will rely on each unitâ€™s internal Web or IT staff to implement the bar. If you have questions about implementation or exceptions, email Web Communications at [web_feedback@ncsu.edu](mailto:web_feedback@ncsu.edu).

### To Use:
Simply activate the plugin - the official NCSU utility bar should show up without any additional customization needed.

### Customizable Options:
There are a few customizable options available under Settings -> NCSU Utility Bar from the WordPress admin dashboard.

* Google Custom Search Code: By default, the search bar will only search ncsu.edu. To search your own site, you must first create a search engine through [Google Custom Search](https://cse.google.com/cse/), then enter your custom search code here.

* Search Placeholder: Customizes the default placeholder text in the search bar

* Max Width: If you are not using a University Communications theme, this value should be set to your site's maximum breakpoint to enable fluid container width. If no width is set, the bar will align its contents to the default [Bootstrap container sizes](https://brand.ncsu.edu/bootstrap/css/#grid-options) and breakpoints.

* Bar Color: Alternate color options for the bar's color. Gray is the most commonly used.

* Use NCSU Brick?: Choose whether to use the NCSU red brick, as seen on the [central NCSU](https://ncsu.edu) page, or a simple link for the home button.
